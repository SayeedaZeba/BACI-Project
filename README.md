# BACI-Project
Developed this web application, as part of a group project, for BACI (Burmese American Community Institute) during my Server-Side Programming course that helps to pair mentees with mentors in order to help them gain proper guidance.
Designed the application using programming languages like PHP, HTML5 and CSS3, alongside with AJAX and JavaScript.
For our database, we used phpMyAdmin. We lost access to the database, so some functionality may not work. Most of our pages rely on storage procedures we created to retrieve and store values into the database.
